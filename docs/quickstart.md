**Interactive setup wizard handles everything for you:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreahaku/gpt5_mcp
cd gpt5-mcp
npm install
npm run build
npm run setup
```

The wizard will:
- âœ… Guide you through API key setup with validation
- âœ… Help choose the best fallback model for your needs
- âœ… Configure cost limits and AI behavior
- âœ… Test your access to OpenAI models
- âœ… Generate ready-to-use Claude configurations
- âœ… Provide step-by-step setup instructions

**Prerequisites:**
- OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- [Verified OpenAI organization](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291-api-organization-verification) (required for GPT-5)
- Node.js 18+ and npm

## ðŸ¤– Using the MCP Server

Once configured, you can use these tools in Claude Code or Claude Desktop:

### Basic GPT-5 Consultation

Ask GPT-5 for help with any task:

```
"Use GPT-5 to explain quantum computing in simple terms"
"Ask GPT-5 to review this code for security issues"
"Get GPT-5's help with optimizing this database query"
```

### File Analysis

Process files through Claude Code's @ syntax:

```
"@config.json Ask GPT-5 to review this configuration for security issues"
"@screenshot.png What UI improvements would GPT-5 suggest for this design?"
"@document.pdf Summarize the key points from this report using GPT-5"
```

### Multi-turn Conversations

Start persistent conversations with GPT-5:

```
"Start a GPT-5 conversation about database optimization"
"Continue the conversation: What about indexing strategies?"
"Continue: How does this apply to time-series data?"
```

### Cost Management

Monitor your OpenAI API usage:

```
"Get cost report for today"
"Show my current spending limits"
"Get usage breakdown for this week"
```

## ðŸ”§ Manual Setup (Advanced)

If you prefer manual configuration, see the [full README](../README.md#-advanced-setup-manual) for detailed instructions.

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Setup wizard fails:**
- Ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed
- Check that your OpenAI API key is valid and starts with `sk-`
- Verify your organization is verified for GPT-5 access

**Server not appearing in Claude:**
- Make sure you completely restart Claude Desktop
- Verify the configuration file path is correct
- Check that `dist/index.js` exists (run `npm run build`)

**API errors:**
- Confirm your API key has sufficient credits
- Some models require special access or verification
- Try a different fallback model if access is denied

**Need help?**
- Check the [main README](../README.md) for detailed troubleshooting
- Verify OpenAI API status at https://status.openai.com/
- Review OpenAI's [organization verification guide](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291-api-organization-verification)

## Examples and Inspiration

Below are some advanced examples showing what's possible with the GPT-5 Responses API directly (this MCP server provides a Claude-friendly interface to these capabilities):
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5",
  input: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn.",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input="Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-5",
        "input": "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
    }'
```

](/docs/guides/images)[

File inputs guide

Learn to use file inputs to the model and extract meaning from documents.

](/docs/guides/pdf-files)

## Extend the model with tools

Give the model access to external data and functions by attaching [tools](/docs/guides/tools). Use built-in tools like web search or file search, or define your own for calling APIs, running code, or integrating with third-party systems.

Web search

Use web search in a response

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5",
  tools: [{ type: "web_search_preview" }],
  input: "What was a positive news story from today?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    input="What was a positive news story from today?"
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-5",
        "tools": [{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
        "input": "what was a positive news story from today?"
    }'
```

File search

Search your files in a response

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"]
    }]
)
print(response)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1",
  input: "What is deep research by OpenAI?",
  tools: [
    {
      type: "file_search",
      vector_store_ids: ["<vector_store_id>"],
    },
  ],
});
console.log(response);
```

Function calling

Call your own function

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const tools = [
  {
    type: "function",
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get current temperature for a given location.",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        location: {

        },
      },
      required: ["location"],
      additionalProperties: false,
    },
    strict: true,
  },
];

const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5",
  input: [
    { role: "user", content: "What is the weather like in Paris today?" },
  ],
  tools,

## Stream responses and build realtime apps

Use serverâ€‘sent [streaming events](/docs/guides/streaming-responses) to show results as theyâ€™re generated, or the [Realtime API](/docs/guides/realtime) for interactive voice and multimodal apps.

Stream server-sent events from the API

```javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const stream = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5",
  input: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Say 'double bubble bath' ten times fast.",
    },
  ],
  stream: true,
});

for await (const event of stream) {
  console.log(event);
}
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

stream = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say 'double bubble bath' ten times fast.",
        },
    ],
    stream=True,
)

for event in stream:
    print(event)
```

[

Use streaming events

Use server-sent events to stream model responses to users fast.

](/docs/guides/streaming-responses)[

Get started with the Realtime API

Use WebRTC or WebSockets for super fast speech-to-speech AI apps.

](/docs/guides/realtime)

## Build agents

Use the OpenAI platform to build [agents](/docs/guides/agents) capable of taking actionâ€”like [controlling computers](/docs/guides/tools-computer-use)â€”on behalf of your users. Use the Agents SDK for [Python](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python) or [TypeScript](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js) to create orchestration logic on the backend.

Build a language triage agent

```javascript
import { Agent, run } from "@openai/agents";

const spanishAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Spanish agent",
  instructions: "You only speak Spanish.",
});

const englishAgent = new Agent({
  name: "English agent",
  instructions: "You only speak English",
